## Choose a theme

### Built-in

It is easy to use one of standard themes available of GitHub Pages by setting the theme value in your config. 

There are about 10 and are listed among gems here:

- https://pages.github.com/versions/

You can also switch between themes with preview, by switching themes within repo Settings 

### Custom 

If you want to use another theme on a GH Pages site, you must use the Remote Theme plugin and point to a GitHub repo.

Or you must use another CI flow like GitHub Actions or Netlify. Then you can put any theme in your config file under `theme`, as long as you also cover it in `Gemfile`.
